            <description><![CDATA[<p>This guide aims to compare <a href="https://github.com/raptorjs3/raptor-templates">Raptor Templates</a> and <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/dustjs">Dust</a> to help guide developers deciding between the two. However, even if you are considering other templating languages, such as Handlebars or Mustache, this guide should still be helpful.</p>
<p>Why Raptor Templates and Dust? Dust represents a well-established text-based templating language and Raptor Templates represents a well-established HTML-based templating language. Raptor Templates was created as an alternative to Dust when Dust was first starting to be used at eBay.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: This guide is my opinion, and as the author of Raptor Templates it is very difficult for me to be unbiased. Also, I&#39;ve used Dust enough to be proficient in it, but I would not claim to be a Dust expert. If you feel that anything is misleading or wrong then please let me know and I will correct it. Also, my goal was to be as objective and as fair as possible, but some things are inherently subjective.</em></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Creating a blog is something I have meant to do for awhile now, but every time I tried to use an existing solution I would be overwhelmed by the urge to create my own blogging platform. I did not want to use a blogging platform that puts restrictions on how I format my website, or for my content to reside in some private database in some proprietary format. I knew I wanted to use a static website generator based on Node.js and Markdown, but when looking at the available options (and there were <a href="http://staticsitegenerators.net/">a lot of them</a>) I found too many restrictions. Which leads to the next topic: I rarely choose the easiest solution if I believe that there is a better solution waiting to be discovered. It took me a little longer to get going, but now I have a website and have introduced a new open source static site generator named <a href="https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/freeze">Freeze</a>.</p>
<p>A little about myself, Iâ€™m currently a Senior Platform Architect at eBay. I started out building web applications, but I now focus mostly on building the platform so that others can build applications more easily. Building frameworks, platforms and tools is a much better fit for me because if I were tasked with building a web application I would typically end up spending too much time on the underlying architecture. </p>
<p>This blog gives me a chance to share my vision for how building web applications can be made easier. I am an open source advocate and you can find many of my projects linked to from this site.</p>
